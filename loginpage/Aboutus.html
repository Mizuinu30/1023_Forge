          <h1>Héctor Vázquez</h1>
          <p>I consider my heart a beacon of lawful good, always striving to do what's right, while my mind dances in the realms of chaotic good, constantly seeking creative and unconventional ways to solve problems. My love for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) extends into a broader appreciation for anime, cartoons, and all things fun, reflecting a vibrant tapestry of narratives and characters that inspire me daily.

            Having honed my skills in customer service, I've developed a deep sense of empathy and a commitment to justice, complemented by a quick wit that helps navigate the complexities of human interactions. These skills have been invaluable, not just in professional settings but in cultivating strong relationships and understanding with those around me. Relationships like the ones with my 'family of loot goblins'—a playful term I use to describe my family's adventurous spirit and collective quest for achieving our goals—I am deeply committed to supporting and uplifting them in every endeavor.

            What drives me most passionately at this time is leveraging technology for the betterment of society. Whether it's through making information more accessible, simplifying tasks with innovative tools, or connecting communities, my mission is to ensure technology serves as a bridge to opportunity and empowerment for all, especially those who have the least.</p>

          <h1>Juan Silva</h1>
          <p>Starting from a background of wealth, my innate curiosity led me on a global exploration, immersing myself in the rich cultures of Japan, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. Each journey enriched my worldview, deepening my understanding of human diversity and igniting a passion for technology.

            This passion found its true calling in software development, where the blend of logic and creativity inspired me to innovate in the digital realm. As I ventured deeper, the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence, fueled by the ethical explorations of Isaac Asimov, captivated me, intertwining with my philosophical inquiries into Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and principles like Ikigai and Kaizen, guiding me toward continuous self-improvement and purpose.

            Identifying with a chaotic neutral stance, I've embraced a journey marked by adaptability and a drive to challenge conventions, particularly in AI and environmental stewardship. My aim is to disrupt existing paradigms with innovative, sustainable solutions, merging my technological pursuits with a broader ambition to contribute to societal good. This path from software development to the frontiers of machine learning reflects my commitment to not only personal growth but also to making a meaningful impact in the technological and social fabric of our world.</p>
